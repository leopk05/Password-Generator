### What I learned

Building this password generator project was a fun experience, despite the fact that I am not particularly skilled in design. However, I decided to create a prototype of the project to confirm my lack of expertise in this area. Nevertheless, I discovered that my strengths lie in implementing functionality.

Throughout the development of this project, I encountered new challenges and learned valuable skills. One notable skill I acquired was working with checkbox switches, which I had not done before. Additionally, how to save the state of checkboxes using JavaScript, which was a new concept for me. And I found that being able to effectively research and find solutions on the internet and language documentation is an essential skill for any programmer, so as long as I have internet I will be able to solve problems.


### Continued development

In my future projects, I plan to focus on implementing front-end functionality while also incorporating back-end technologies, such as Spring, and front-end libraries like React, to create dynamic and interactive Single Page Applications (SPAs).

By combining front-end and back-end technologies, I aim to develop applications with improved functionality and performance, while also incorporating user feedback to implement additional features. I am committed to staying up-to-date with industry best practices and technologies to create innovative and user-friendly applications.

I am excited to continue expanding my skills and knowledge in front-end and back-end development to build powerful and scalable applications that meet the needs of modern users.
